## RuleOak Core v2.2.0

RuleOak Core v2.2.0 is the public developer release for adding governance to AI tool calls. It consolidates protocol conformance, policy packs, adapter examples, approval UX, audit reporting, signed integrity, real evidence connector foundations, and a local approval/audit product surface into a clean external package.

### Highlights

- Demo GIF for the tool-call governance flow
- Governance Protocol v1 conformance kit with golden records, canonical hash fixtures, replayable evidence/audit fixtures, and compatibility badges
- Policy-pack manifests, scenario tests, explain/diff support, compatibility checks, and signatures
- Adapter examples for LangGraph-style, CrewAI-style, MCP proxy, and coding-agent boundaries
- Real read-only evidence connector foundation for GitHub, Jira, ServiceNow, Confluence, GitLab, Prometheus, and Grafana-style systems
- Approval UX v2 with reviewer comments, evidence requests, SLA metadata, decision history, and approval packets
- Audit Report Viewer v2 with verification state, redaction view, report comparison, and audit-packet export
- Local approval/audit product surface for external developer testing
- Signed policy packs, signed evidence bundles, signed audit chains, and offline verification
- Reference verticals for AI coding agents, enterprise RAG answers, personal local-first assistants, and SRE monitoring change governance
- External-facing GitHub issue templates, CI guidance, launch checklist, and package-publish guardrails
