RuleOak Core introduces read-only evidence connector patterns.

The purpose is to let governed workflows collect context from systems such as source-control, ticketing, and local documentation without giving the agent write access.

## Included in v2.1.0

- local file evidence connector
- GitHub read-only fixture connector
- Jira read-only fixture connector
- evidence connector runner
- deterministic evidence hash helper
- read-only connector report
- tests and demo

## Boundary

The v2.1.0 connectors are intentionally conservative.

They do not:

- call external networks
- require credentials
- update GitHub, Jira, or external systems
- create tickets, comments, commits, pull requests, or messages
- replace future production connectors

They do:

- prove the RuleOak connector pattern
- collect evidence records
- mark records as read-only
- generate audit-style reports
- provide a safe foundation for future approval-gated write connectors

## Run the demo

```bash
npm run connector:demo
npm run report:html
```

The demo uses local fixtures under `examples/evidence-connectors-demo/fixtures/`.

## Why read-only first

Read-only evidence connectors are safer than write connectors. They help an agent reason with context while keeping external systems protected. Future write connectors should be approval-gated and should keep clear audit records before any external update occurs.


## Jira read-only evidence connector

RuleOak Core v2.1.0 includes a real Jira read-only evidence connector. Use `npm run jira:demo` for fixture mode and `npm run jira:demo:real` with `RULEOAK_JIRA_BASE_URL` plus a JQL/project setting for live GET-only collection. The connector does not write to Jira.

## Enterprise evidence connector path

RuleOak now includes a RuleOak Core v2.1.0 reference for broader enterprise evidence connectors. See `docs/connectors/enterprise-evidence-connectors.md` and run:

```bash
npm run enterprise:connectors
```

The reference keeps the same read-only boundary: collect evidence, summarize sensitive/high-volume data, avoid credential storage, and avoid writes.
